# Build it

# Run it
#  -P                   -> maps random port-numbers of host to all exposed ports.
#  --rm                 -> deletes the container automatically once its stoped (so that the name can be re-used again)
#  --name               -> we always name our container devbox
#  --privileged         -> not sure what privilge is needed
#  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY  -> expose our host DISPLAY
#  -v ..:..             -> DISPLAY is useful only with X-11 permissions!
#  -u lakshman          -> start as this user.
#  -t                   -> VERY IMP: give a tty to the container
#  -i                   -> VERY IMP: make the container interactive
#  lakshmankumar/devbox -> use this image.
